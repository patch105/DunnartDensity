The Julia Creek Dunnart (_Sminthopsis douglasi_) is an endangered small mammal found in central west Queensland, Australia. This project aims to provide the first population density and population size estimates for _S. douglasi_ within a national park. Density and population size are estimated via spatially explicit capture-recapture, using live capture data collected over seven trapping sessions between 2022 and 2023.  

Code and data provided here outline the analysis of _S. douglasi_ capture-recapture data. 

Further details of the project methods, results, and discussion are presented in our paper entitled: "Density of a cryptic Australian small mammal: the threatened Julia Creek Dunnart (_Sminthopsis douglasi_)" Ecology and Evolution. A. H. Bakker, Patterson C.R., Mifsud G., Reside A., Fuller S., and Baker A.M.

The data/code presented here include:
- captfile.txt : The capture-recapture data from the two trapping grids (scrammy and campbells), including individual animal IDs, the occasion (trap night), and the detector (trap) that the animal was caught in
- trapfile.txt : The coordinates of traps in the grid
- Dunnar_Density.qmd : All code used to run the spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis within a Quarto document
- Dunnart_Density.html : All code used to run the spatially explicit capture-recapture analysis in html format
